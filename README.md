# Financial Transaction Tracker Capstone 1 Refactor

Welcome to the Financial Transaction Tracker repository! This project represents a significant refactor of our initial Java capstone project, originally designed as a static application for managing financial transactions stored in CSV format. This project started as a solo assignment but ended up transforming it into a collaborative effort, introducing powerful enhancements to functionality and usability.

## Project Evolution

### From Static to Dynamic

Previously relying on static CSV files, we've migrated to a MySQL database backend. This transition allows for real-time data management, improving scalability, reliability, and performance. Now, all transactions are securely stored and managed within the MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and enabling advanced querying capabilities.

### Enhanced Features

#### User Authentication and Registration

We've introduced robust user authentication and registration features, enhancing security and personalization. Users can securely log in, access their personalized accounts, and manage transactions seamlessly.

#### Real-time Updates and Error Handling

Integration with the MySQL database connector enables live updates, ensuring that transactions are processed and reflected instantaneously. We've also bolstered error handling mechanisms, particularly around user authentication, to provide a smooth and reliable user experience.

## Key Features

### Interactive Home Screen
